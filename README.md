#Flat Colors Push Buttons

This is set of buttons, that I have used in my projects. Feel free to use it and modify it for your specific needs.

##Usage

To create a button add class .button.
If you want the button to be rounded, then add class .rounded.
Finally add the flat color name as a class.

##Demo
